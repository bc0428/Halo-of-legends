# Halo-of-legends

This project is made for the final assignment of the course Programming Design (II), NCKU. <br><br>
Halo of legends is a 2D game written in Java, the game consists of 5 levels and players can choose from 4 characters. In each level, players will fight enemies in a maze and once all of them are eliminated, the player is cleared for the next level. There are supplements within the maze and inter-level spaces, which could be use to upgrade the character and its weapon to boost its power.<br><br>

Each character will share a common weapon and also an unique secondary weapon, which has different stats and trajectory.<br>
